# Project Name
> an off-canvas menu component

## General info
This is an exercise where I learned how to make this component, an off-canvas side menu, part of Zell Liew's Learn JavaScript course (lessons Off-canvas menu: Building an off-canvas menu and Off-canvas menu: Animations).

## Inspiration
A simple exercise that shows how JavaScript working together with CCS can also be a simple thing to make a website better.

## Technologies

## Status
Exercise carried out and customised with information from a website I recently worked on, kollektivorort.
